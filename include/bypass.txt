# This file contains OAuth2/OIDC clients that should bypass the CILogon
# "Select an Identity Provider" screen and go directly to a specific 
# Identity Provider. Each line of the file has the following format:
#
#    URI entityId
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' (no leading spaces) are skipped.
#
# The URI must be a PHP PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expression). See
# http://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php for details on syntax.
# Note that '#' should not be used as a delimiter since lines beginning with
# '#' (pound/hash) are skipped as comments. '%' (percent) is a good choice
# for delimiter so that slashes do not need to be escaped. Note that period
# '.' matches any character, so if you want to match a dot, prefix with a
# backslash, e.g., '\.' . However, in practice this unnecessary since dots
# appear mainly in the FQDN.
# 
# The URI regex should match one of:
#    * an OAuth2.0 redirect_uri
#    * an Oauth2.0 client_id
#
# The entityId must exactly match the IdP metadata value.
#
# If an incoming OIDC redirect_uri or client_id is matched from this file,
# the associated IdP will be automatically used. This is used primarily by
# campus gateways (portals) where users only ever log in with a single IdP.
# It replaces the complex skin configuration which required a combination
# of <forceinitialidp>, <allowforceinitialidp>, and <portallist>.
