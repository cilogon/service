<!-- This is a sample configuration file for a 'skin'. It contains examples
     of all of the available program options. Simply copy this file to the
     appropriate skin subdirectory, rename it to 'config.xml', and uncomment
     and configure the desired sections.

     Note that most skins are now stored in the database:

     # mysql -u cilogon -p -e 'describe ciloa2.skins;'
     Enter password: <password in config.secrets.php>
     +========+==============+======+=====+=========+=======+
     | Field  | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
     +========+==============+======+=====+=========+=======+
     | name   | varchar(255) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
     | config | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | css    | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     +========+==============+======+=====+=========+=======+

     However, you can still create a subdirectory in /var/www/html/skin
     with corresponding config.xml and skin.css files and use it with the
     "?skin=..." parameter. This is primarily for testing skins and adding
     new skins. When you are satisified with the new skin, you can write it
     to the database using /var/www/html/util/skintodb.php which reads all
     subdirectories in the 'skin' directory and writes them to the database.
     Note that the filesystem skin configs are preferred over the dataabase
     configs, so be sure to delete the filesystem configs after you have
     loaded them into the database.

  <!-- <initialidp>
       When users first visit the cilogon.org page, they are presented with
       a list of IdPs. By default, ORCID is initially highlighted. You can
       change this behavior by specifying a different initial IdP. (Use the
       entityId for InCommon, IdP endpoint URL for OpenID.) In the example
       here, ProtectNetwork is selected initially.

       Note there is also a query parameter "?initialidp=..." which does the
       same thing without having to specify a skin. However, the query
       parameter overrides the skin value if one is configured.

  <!-- <forceinitialidp>
       This option can be used in conjunction with <initialidp> or
       "selected_idp" (an OIDC optional URL query parameter). This
       option is functionally equivalent to having the "Remember this
       selection" checkbox checked on the IdP selection page. When set to 1,
       <forceinitialidp> bypasses the IdP selection page and immediately
       redirects the user to either the "selected_idp" (if present) or the
       <initialidp>. Note that it does NOT actually check the "Remember this
       selection" checkbox (as the checkbox sets the 'keepidp' cookie), but
       rather forces a redirect to the "selected_idp" or the <initialidp>
       every time. In the case that both "selected_idp" and <initialidp> are
       set, "selected_idp" takes precedence. See also the
       <allowforceinitialidp> option in the <portallistaction> section below
       to restrict this behavior to a certain set of portal callback URIs.

       The Incommon Metadata asserts the Registration Authority for each

       Registration Authorities (RegAuth for short) by listing them here.
       Notes:
       (1) The <regauthgreenlit> and <regauthredlit> lists are processed
           BEFORE the <idpgreenlit> and <idpredlit> lists, so you can use
           both types to refine the list of IdPs.
       (2) OAuth2 IdPs (e.g., GitHub, Google, Microsoft, ORCID) are NOT
           affected by <regauthgreenlit> or <regauthredlit>. To add
           OAuth2 IdPs when using <regauthgreenlit>, use <idpgreenlit>.
           To remove OAuth2 IdPs when using <regauthredlit>, use <idpredlit>.
       To get the current list of Registration Authorities, visit
       https://technical.edugain.org/status or run the following command:

           curl -s https://mdq.incommon.org/entities/idps/all | \
           grep registrationAuthority | \
           sed 's/.*registrationAuthority="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | \

       to a subset by listing only those IdPs you want shown for the skin.

  <!-- <idphidden>
       CIL-1632 This is a list of "hidden" IdPs which are still technically
       in the "Select an Identity Provider" list, but have the "hidden"
       <option> attribute set so that they are not displayed to the user.
       This is typically used in conjunction with <idpgreenlit> for clients
       who want only THEIR IdPs to be shown to their users, but CILogon
       admins still need the ability to log in to their COmanage instance
       for testing. There are two ways to override the hidden IdP list:
       (1) Pass a query parameter "?showhidden"/"?showhiddenidps" (with or
       without a value like "?showhidden=1") to a cilogon.org endpoint.
       This sets a PHP session variable to always show the IdPs in the
       <idphidden> list, so you need to do this just once (until the PHP
       session cookie is cleared). If you pass "?showhidden=0", the session
       variable will be UNset (or you can unset it using the /me/ page).
       (2) Pass the "idphint" query parameter with the IdP's URL-encoded
       entityId, e.g.,
           https://cilogon.org/?idphint=urn%3Amace%3Aincommon%3Auiuc.edu
       NOTE: If you set this config option, you MUST also set <initialidp>
       (above) to a non-redlit, non-hidden IdP in case all of the
       recentidps should be hidden.

  <!-- <portallist>
       This block contains a list of regular expressions which attempt to
       match up to a portal's "callback url" (a.k.a. Service URL) or client
       ID. Each <portal> listed is a Perl-Compatible Regular Expression
       (PCRE), which is matched against the callback URI (OAuth1.0),
       redirect_uri (OAuth2.0), or client_id (OAuth2.0) as passed by the
       portal. The callback URI typically looks like
       "https://my.site.org/portal-service/ready". You need to give a
       regular expression, including the delimeters (e.g., percent "%" is a
       good choice so slashes don't need to be escaped). For information
       about PHP's PCRE syntax, see
       http://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php . Once you have
       specified a list of <portal> regular expressions, you also need to
       specify a <portallistaction> below, which tells the program what to
       do if the portal's callback URL matches a <portal> in the list. The
       example below matches hostnames in the ".ncsa.uiuc.edu" domain.

  <!-- <portallistaction>
       This block works in conjunction with the <portallist> block. It has
       options for what should happen if a portal callback url or client id
       is found in the <portallist>. This section may grow as we find new
       uses for the <portallist>. The options in this section are
       independent of each other.
       <hideportalinfo> If present, set to 1. This allows you to hide the
       Portal Info block (Site Name / Site URL / Service URL) for portals
       in the <portallist> (rather than hiding it for the entire skin, as is
       currently possible via CSS).
       <allowforceinitialidp> If present, set to 1. This option is used in
       conjunction with <forceinitialidp> (and <initialidp> or
       "selected_idp"). If set, then <forceinitialidp> is valid only for
       portals in the <portallist>. This prevents a malicious portal
       sysadmin from specifying a skin that has <forceinitialidp> (and
       <initialidp>/"selected_idp") set, but using it for their portal when
       they have no business doing so. Basically, it limits the
       <forceinitialidp> behavior to a specific set of portals.

       "forceAuthn=true" for the AuthnRequest when initiating the session.
