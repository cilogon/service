<!-- This is a sample configuration file for a 'skin'. It contains examples
     of all of the available program options. Simply copy this file to the
     appropriate skin subdirectory, rename it to 'config.xml', and uncomment
     and configure the desired sections.

     Note that most skins are now stored in the database:

     # mysql -u cilogon -p -e 'describe ciloa2.skins;'
     Enter password: <password in config.secrets.php>
     +========+==============+======+=====+=========+=======+
     | Field  | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
     +========+==============+======+=====+=========+=======+
     | name   | varchar(255) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
     | config | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | css    | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     +========+==============+======+=====+=========+=======+

     However, you can still create a subdirectory in /var/www/html/skin
     with corresponding config.xml and skin.css files and use it with the
     "?skin=..." parameter. This is primarily for testing skins and adding
     new skins. When you are satisified with the new skin, you can write it
     to the database using /var/www/html/util/skintodb.php which reads all
     subdirectories in the 'skin' directory and writes them to the database.
     Note that the filesystem skin configs are preferred over the dataabase
     configs, so be sure to delete the filesystem configs after you have
     loaded them into the database.

  <!-- <initialidp>
       When a user first visits the cilogon.org page, he is presented with a
       list of IdPs. By default, Google is initially highlighted. You can
       change this behavior by specifying a different initial IdP. (Use the
       entityId for InCommon, IdP endpoint URL for OpenID.) In the example
       here, ProtectNetwork is selected initially.

       Note there is also a query parameter "?initialidp=..." which does the
       same thing without having to specify a skin. However, the query
       parameter overrides the skin value if one is configured.

  <!-- <forceinitialidp>
       This option can be used in conjunction with <initialidp> or
       "selected_idp" (an OIDC optional URL query parameter). This
       option is functionally equivalent to having the "Remember this
       selection" checkbox checked on the IdP selection page. When set to 1,
       <forceinitialidp> bypasses the IdP selection page and immediately
       redirects the user to either the "selected_idp" (if present) or the
       <initialidp>. Note that it does NOT actually check the "Remember this
       selection" checkbox (as the checkbox sets the 'keepidp' cookie), but
       rather forces a redirect to the "selected_idp" or the <initialidp>
       every time. In the case that both "selected_idp" and <initialidp> are
       set, "selected_idp" takes precedence. See also the
       <allowforceinitialidp> option in the <portallistaction> section below
       to restrict this behavior to a certain set of portal callback URIs.

  <!-- <regauthgreenlit>
       The Incommon Metadata asserts the Registration Authority for each

       Registration Authorities (RegAuth for short) by listing them here.
       Notes:
       (1) The <regauthgreenlit> and <regauthredlit> lists are processed
           BEFORE the <idpgreenlit> and <idpredlit> lists, so you can use
           both types to refine the list of IdPs.
       (2) OAuth2 IdPs (e.g., GitHub, Google, Microsoft, ORCID) are NOT
           affected by <regauthgreenlit> or <regauthredlit>. To remove
           the OAuth2 IdPs, use <idpredlit>.
       To get the current list of Registration Authorities, visit
       https://technical.edugain.org/status or run the following command:

           curl -s https://mdq.incommon.org/entities/idps/all | \
           grep registrationAuthority | \
           sed 's/.*registrationAuthority="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | \
           sort | uniq

       In the example below, we allow IdPs that are registered by

       The cilogon.org service maintains a global list of available IdPs in
       the file /var/www/html/include/idplist.xml. The IdPs are shown
       to the user on the "Log On" page. You can cull this list down
       to a subset by listing only those IdPs you want shown for the skin.
       (Use the entityIds for InCommon, IdP endpoint URLs for OpenID.)

  <!-- <idphidden>
       CIL-1632 This is a list of "hidden" IdPs which are still technically
       in the "Select an Identity Provider" list, but have the "hidden"
       <option> attribute set so that they are not displayed to the user.
       This is typically used in conjunction with <idpgreenlit> for clients
       who want only THEIR IdPs to be shown to their users, but CILogon
       admins still need the ability to log in to their COmanage instance
       for testing. There are two ways to override the hidden IdP list:
       (1) Pass a query parameter "?showhidden"/"?showhiddenidps" (with or
       without a value like "?showhidden=1") to a cilogon.org endpoint.
       This sets a PHP session variable to always show the IdPs in the
       <idphidden> list, so you need to do this just once (until the PHP
       session cookie is cleared). If you pass "?showhidden=0", the session
       variable will be UNset (or you can unset it using the /me/ page).
       (2) Pass the "idphint" query parameter with the IdP's URL-encoded
       entityId, e.g.,
           https://cilogon.org/?idphint=urn%3Amace%3Aincommon%3Auiuc.edu
       NOTE: If you set this config option, you MUST also set <initialidp>
       (above) to a non-redlit, non-hidden IdP in case all of the
       recentidps should be hidden.

  <!-- <pkcs12>
       This block contains options specific to the "Get New Certificate" box
       (i.e. download a PKCS12 credential).
       The <initiallifetime> block allows you to specify the initial value
       for "Certificate Lifetime". If set, you must specify BOTH <number>
       AND <multiplier>.
       <number> is the value that appears in the text input box.
       <multiplier> can be 1 (=> number is in hours), 24 (=> number is in
       days), or 732 (=> number is in months). The example below shows the
       default of 13 months, which is also the maximum lifetime.
       <minlifetime> allows to you specify the minimum lifetime (in hours) a
       user can enter for the credential. Defaults to 1. Should not be less
       than 1.
       <maxlifetime> allows you to specify the maximum lifetime (in hours) a
       user can enter for the credential. Defaults to 9516 (which equals 13
       months). Should not be greater than 9516.
       Note: The program checks for 1 <= minlifetime <= initiallifetime <=
       maxlifetime <= 9516.
       <disable> If set to 1, downloading PKCS12 certificates is disabled.
       Instead, a message will be shown to the user stating that PKCS12
       certificates cannot be downloaded due to restriction. The actual
       message can be overridden with the <disabledmessage> option.
       <disabledmessage> overrides the default message shown to the user
       when <disabled> is set to 1. If using HTML in the message, be sure
       to encode any special characters (such as '<') to HTML entities.

  <!-- <delegate>
       This block contains options specific to the "Delegate" page (i.e.
       when a certificate is delegated to a portal).
       <initiallifetime> allows you to specify the initial value for
       "Certificate Lifetime (in hours)" for the current portal. This
       defaults to 12. Maximum value is 240. Note that this value is
       utilized ONLY IF there is not a remember and/or lifetime cookie set
       for the current portal.
       <initialremember> If present, set to 1. This checks the "Remember my
       OK for this portal" checkbox when the user first visits the site.
       This means that the user's first visit will show _only_ the IdP
       selection page; all subsequent pages will continue automatically.
       Note that this value is utilized ONLY IF there is not a remember
       and/or lifetime cookie set for the current portal. If you set this
       value, you should probably also set the <initiallifetime> value,
       unless you want to use the default value of 12.
       <forcelifetime> Allows you specify the value for "Certificate
       Lifetime (in hours)" for ALL visits from the current portal. Maximum
       value is 240. This setting overrides the lifetime cookie (if any),
       and also "grays out" the lifetime input box to prevent the user from
       specifying a lifetime of the delegated credential.
       <forceremember> If present, set to 1. This virtually checks the
       "Remember my OK for this portal checkbox" for ALL visits from the
       current portal. This settings overrides the remember cookie (if
       any), which means that the Allow/Deny delegate page will never be
       shown to the user. If you set this value, you should probably
       also set the <forcelifetime> value, unless you want to use the
       default value of 12.
       NOTE: While you can specify the <initial...> and the <force...>
       values at the same time, it probably doesn't make a lot of sense
       since the <force...> parameters override the cookies set by the
       <initial...> parameters.
       <minlifetime> allows to you specify the minimum lifetime (in hours) a
       user can enter for the delegated certificate. Defaults to 1. Should
       not be less than 1.
       <maxlifetime> allows you to specify the maximum lifetime (in hours) a
       user can enter for the delegated certificate. Defaults to 240 (which
       equals 10 days). Should not be greater than 240.
       Note: The program checks for 1 <= minlifetime <= initiallifetime <=
       maxlifetime <= 240. However, it does not do the same for
       forcelifetime, so be sure that forcelifetime is in the range
       [1..240].

  <!-- <ecp>
       This block is specific to fetching an X.509 certificate using
       an ECP-enabled client (e.g. "ecp.pl -g c"). This does NOT apply to
       fetching a PKCS12 credential using an ECP-enabled client
       (e.g. "ecp.pl -g p") which is handled by the <pkcs12> block above.
       <defaultlifetime> can be used to specify a default lifetime (in
       hours) when the client does not give one. Typically, the
       MYPROXY_LIFETIME value of 12 hours (found in include/myproxy.php) is
       used when the lifetime is not given. You can set it to some other
       value with this option.
       <minlifetime> allows you to specify the minimum lifetime (in hours) a
       user can enter for the certificate. Defaults to 1. Should not be less
       than 1.
       <maxlifetime> allows you to specify the maximum lifetime (in hours) a
       user can enter for the certificate. Defaults to 277 (which equals
       1000000 seconds). Should not be greater than 277.
       Note: The program checks for 1 <= minlifetime <= defaultlifetime <=
       maxlifetime <= 277, and also checks to make sure the specified
       lifetime is within [minlifetime..maxlifetime].

  <!-- <portallist>
       This block contains a list of regular expressions which attempt to
       match up to a portal's "callback url" (a.k.a. Service URL) or client
       ID. Each <portal> listed is a Perl-Compatible Regular Expression
       (PCRE), which is matched against the callback URI (OAuth1.0),
       redirect_uri (OAuth2.0), or client_id (OAuth2.0) as passed by the
       portal. The callback URI typically looks like
       "https://my.site.org/portal-service/ready". You need to give a
       regular expression, including the delimeters (e.g., percent "%" is a
       good choice so slashes don't need to be escaped). For information
       about PHP's PCRE syntax, see
       http://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php . Once you have
       specified a list of <portal> regular expressions, you also need to
       specify a <portallistaction> below, which tells the program what to
       do if the portal's callback URL matches a <portal> in the list. The
       example below matches hostnames in the ".ncsa.uiuc.edu" domain.

       This block works in conjunction with the <portallist> block. It has
       options for what should happen if a portal callback url or client id
       is found in the <portallist>. This section may grow as we find new
       uses for the <portallist>. The options in this section are
       independent of each other.
       <hideportalinfo> If present, set to 1. This allows you to hide the
       Portal Info block (Site Name / Site URL / Service URL) for portals
       in the <portallist> (rather than hiding it for the entire skin, as is
       currently possible via CSS).
       <allowforceinitialidp> If present, set to 1. This option is used in
       conjunction with <forceinitialidp> (and <initialidp> or
       "selected_idp"). If set, then <forceinitialidp> is valid only for
       portals in the <portallist>. This prevents a malicious portal
       sysadmin from specifying a skin that has <forceinitialidp> (and
       <initialidp>/"selected_idp") set, but using it for their portal when
       they have no business doing so. Basically, it limits the
       <forceinitialidp> behavior to a specific set of portals.

       * rfc2253 - This displays the DN in the "rfc2253" format as used in

    CILogon facilitates secure access to CyberInfrastructure (CI).
    In order to use the CILogon Service, you must first select
    an identity provider. An identity provider (IdP) is an
    organization where you have an account and can log on
    to gain access to online services.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you are a faculty, staff, or student member of a university
    or college, please select it for your identity provider.
    If your school is not listed, please contact &lt;a
    href=\'mailto:' . EMAIL_HELP . '\'&gt;' . EMAIL_HELP . '&lt;/a&gt;,
    and we will try to add your school in the future.

       Set to 1 to essentially disable the recent IdPs from showing at the
