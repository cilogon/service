<!-- This is a sample configuration file for a 'skin'.  It contains examples
     of all of the available program options.  Simply copy this file to the
     appropriate skin subdirectory, rename it to 'config.xml', and uncomment
     and configure the desired sections.

  <!-- <initialidp>
       When a user first visits the cilogon.org page, he is presented with a
       list of IdPs.  By default, Google is initially highlighted.  You can
       change this behavior by specifying a different initial IdP.  (Use the
       entityId for InCommon, IdP endpoint URL for OpenID.) In the example
       here, ProtectNetwork is selected initially.

  <!-- <idpwhitelist>
       The cilogon.org service maintains a global list of available IdPs in
       the file /var/www/html/include/whitelist.txt.  This full list is
       typically shown to the user on the "Log On" page.  You can cull this
       list down to a subset by listing only those IdPs you want shown for
       the skin.  Basically, the resulting list is an intersection of the
       global whitelist and the list of IdPs below.  (Use the entityIds for
       InCommon, IdP endpoint URLs for OpenID.) In this example, we show
       only IdPs starting with the letter 'P'.

  <!-- <idpblacklist>
       The cilogon.org service maintains a global list of available IdPs in
       the file /var/www/html/include/whitelist.txt.  This full list is
       typically shown to the user on the "Log On" page.  You can remove
       IdPs from the list by specifying them in the blacklist below.  (Use
       the entityIds for InCommon, IdP endpoint URLs for OpenID.) In this
       example, we remove the OpenID providers from the list.

  <!-- <pkcs12>
       This block contains options specific to the "Get New Certificate" box
       (i.e. download a PKCS12 credential).  The <initiallifetime> block
       allows you to specify the initial value for "Certificate Lifetime".
       If set, you must specify BOTH <number> AND <multiplier>.
       <number> is the value that appears in the text input box.
       <multiplier> can be 1 (=> number is in hours), 24 (=> number is in
       days), or 732 (=> number is in months).  The example below shows the
       default of 13 months, which is also the maximum lifetime.
  -->
  <!--
  <pkcs12>
    <initiallifetime>
      <number>13</number>
      <multiplier>732</multiplier>
    </initiallifetime>
  </pkcs12>
  -->


  <!-- <gsca>
       This block contains options specific to the "Download Certificate"
       box (i.e. use the GridShib-CA JWS client to download a credential).
       The <initiallifetime> block allows you to specify the initial value
       for the "Lifetime".  Note that these values are typically set by the
       gridshib-ca.conf file, but will be overridden by the values here.
       If set, you must specify BOTH <number> AND <multiplier>.
       <number> is the value that appears in the text input box.
       <multiplier> can be 3600 (=> number is in hours), 86400 (=> number is
       in days), or 2635200 (=> number is in months).  The example below
       shows the default of 12 hours.  Maximum is 13 months (2635200).

  <!--

      <multiplier>3600</multiplier>
    </initiallifetime>
  </gsca>

  <!-- <delegate>
       This block contains options specific to the "Delegate" page (i.e.
       when a certificate is delegated to a portal).  Note that options in
       this section are independent of each other.
       <initiallifetime> allows you to specify the initial value for
       "Certificate Lifetime (in hours)". This defaults to 12.  Maximum
       value is 240.
       <remember> If present, set to 1. The checkbox for "Remember my OK
       for this portal" is virtually clicked when the user first visits the
       site.  (Actually, the program simply sets a cookie for the checkbox.)
       This means that the user's first visit will show _only_ the IdP
       selection page as all subsequent pages will continue automatically.
  -->
  <!--
  <delegate>
    <initiallifetime>12</initiallifetime>
    <remember>1</remember>
  </delegate>
  -->


  <!-- <portallist>
       This block contains a list of regular expressions which attempt to
       match up to a portal's "callback url" (a.k.a. Service URL).  Each
       <portal> listed is actually a Perl-Compatible Regular Expression
       (PCRE), which is matched against the callback URI as passed by the
       portal to the CILogon Delegate service.  The callback URI typically
       looks like "https://my.site.org/portal-service/ready". You need
       to give a regular expression, including the delimeters (slash and 
       pound are common).  For information about PHP's PCRE syntax, see 
       http://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php .  Once you have
       specified a list of <portal> regular expressions, you also need to
       specify a <portallistaction> below, which tells the program what to
       do if the portal's callback URL matches a <portal> in the list.
       The example below matches hostnames in the ".ncsa.uiuc.edu" domain.
  -->
  <!--
  <portallist>
    <portal>/.*\.ncsa\.uiuc\.edu/</portal>
  </portallist>
  -->

  <!-- <portallistaction>
       This block works in conjunction with the <portallist> block. It has
       options for what should happen if a portal callback url is found in
       the <portallist>.  This section may grow as we find new uses for the
       <portallist>.  The options in this section are independent of each
       other.
       <hideportalinfo> If present, set to 1.  This allows you to hide the
       Portal Info block (Site Name / Site URL / Service URL) for portals
       in the <portallist> (rather than hiding it for the entire skin, as is
       currently possible via CSS).

  <!--
  <portallistaction>
    <hideportalinfo>1</hideportalinfo>
