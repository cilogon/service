# This file contains IdPs and Portals that should have a skin
# applied by force. Each line of the file has the following format:
#
#    URI skinname
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' (no leading spaces) are skipped.
#
# The URI must be a PHP PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expression). See
# http://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php for details on syntax.
# Note that '#' should not be used as a delimiter since lines beginning with
# '#' (pound/hash) are skipped as comments. '%' (percent) is a good choice
# for delimiter so that slashes do not need to be escaped.
#
# The URI regex should match either an IdP entityID or a portal callbackURL.
# In the case that both an IdP entityID and a portal callbackURL match, the
# skinname for the IdP entityID takes precedence. Skinname is case-insensitive.
